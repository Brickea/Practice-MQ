Consider such a situation, the media like BBC wants to report a match result. It's stupid that the media call everyone to inform them of the result, right? 

So people usually subscribe to the BBC and will receive the message once the media are public the message.

This kind of structure can also be used to decouple the producer and consumer. 

And in most cases, messages need to be processed in a FIFO order. Now you will thinging about the queue. And this is what we called "Message Queue". In addition, it is MOM (Message-oriented Middleware)

Here are some common MOM with my learning notes.
